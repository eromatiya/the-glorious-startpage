### Important Note

+ Typing your search query will automatically open the search box. You can also open it by pressing on the leftmost button in panel or by clicking your profile picture.
+ I'm using the `backdrop-filter` property to have the blur effect for the panels. If you're using Firefox, find `layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled` then enable it.
+ The configuration file can be found in `modern-startpage/js/config.js`. You can set your credentials in weather forecast and your default search engine here.
+ Openweather map API key is not included!

	How to get a credentials for the weather forecast?

	- OpenWeatherMap is the weather provider, so go to OpenWeatherMap's [website](https://home.openweathermap.org/).
	- Register, log-in, and then go [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) to generate your very own API keys. 
	- Put your credentials in `modern-startpage/js/config.js`.

+ The code could be better, this is my first time writing a startpage from the ground up. I will improve this from time to time.
+ If you discovered a bug or error in the logs, please open an issue so I can fix it.
+ Tested only on Firefox and Google Chrome.
